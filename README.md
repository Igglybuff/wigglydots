# wigglydots
My dotfiles and scripts and stuff.

**Tidbits**

  * The imgur.py script depends on you defining an imgur API key as an environment variable. (e.g. in ~/.zshrc)
  * The 'wigglyscrot.sh' script is really only for me, but you can easily modify that to work with your own server.
  * Mescaline is an unreleased project, hence why the directory is locked. Everything should function correctly sans-mescaline, however.
