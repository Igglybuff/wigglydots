# wigglydots
My dotfiles and scripts and stuff.

**Tidbits**

  * The imgur.py script depends on you defining an imgur API key as an environment variable. (e.g. in ~/.zshrc)

	```console
	echo "export IMGUR_API_KEY='your api key here'" >> ~/.zshrc
	```

  * The 'wigglyscrot.sh' script is really only for me, but you can easily modify that to work with your own server.
